### Instructions on how to play
The aim of the game is to stay caffeinated. The user gets points for visiting a cafe, and loses points for visitng a location labelled decaf. The number of points for each cafe varies, and is randomized. But if you visit the same cafe twice, you get the same points for it both times, i.e. the points are only randomized at the start of the game. You can visit a cafe multiple times to increase your score, similarly visiting the same decaf location multiple times decreases your score too. Every time you get caffeine, the number of seconds since you have had caffeine resets to 0. The aim of the game is to get as many points as you can.

### What was your starting idea? What did you try to build?
Our starting idea was to do something related to coffee because it's a part of people's everyday routine and there are so many cafes around us in Evanston itself. So we tried to build a game where people could go to these various cafes and get coffee to keep them going through the day.

### What were you asking players to imagine about the space?
We asked players to imagine that they are walking around Evanston and cafes are like their fuel to increase points, while decaf locations are the evil entities that take away their points.

### What did you ask players to change about their normal relationship to the space? 
Their normal relationship to the space was to probably visit the cafe only once or twice, but we asked them to keep making multiple visits regularly. We also asked them to see the decaf locations as something negative and evil, which they would not normally do.

### How did you make use of edges, nodes, landmarks, districts, or paths in your game?
We indicate the distance of each location that the user could go to, and also used the actual cafes around us as our cafes in the space to gain points. Having the landmarks and paths clearly shown in the map allows the user to know where these cafes are, in the game as well as in real life.

### What happened when they played? What did they talk about, what was hard, where did they go?
The initial reaction was that they were excited with the concept of the game. People who live in Evanston loved that they could see their favourite cafes that they actually go to even outside the game, which made their character in the game relatable. They joked about how dependent they are on caffeine themselves and which their go to cafe is. 
They were also very vocal when reacting to hitting a decaf spot. People had fun with the automove because it gave them lesser control over avoiding decaf locations, which made it more challenging to get points. 
It was hard for them to figure out what distance is "too close" when it came to the decaf locations.
They went to their favourite cafe first, and almost always went to starbucks because for some reason, they all thought it would give them more points than other cafes but that was rarely ever the case. They also went to different decaf locations to see how many points they would lose.

### Ask your players (or yourself) about what they noticed about the space
They noticed that :
-The cafes were exactly where they are in real life
-The character doesn't necessarily need to walk on the streets and can walk over buildings and in the water
-One of the cafes, Coralie, is fairly far away and they had to zoom out to find it
-Two of the decaf locations were very close to each other with no cafes nearby so it was an obvious choice to avoid that section of the map

### What is one quote from the reading that applies to your experience.  Explain how.
"To understand this, we must consider not just the city as a thing in itself, but the city being perceived by its inhabitants."
This is the concept we built upon to create our game and explain it to the players. We leveraged their perception of everyday life and how coffee is an essential part of it. People (the city's inhabitants) don't perceive cafes as buildings in the city as much as they perceive them as places where they could get their daily dose of coffee to have a productive day. The incentive in real life is their increased efficiency to do work, and in game, it's the points they get.
